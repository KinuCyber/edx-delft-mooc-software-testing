| Boundary Analysis |

| CORRECT Convention |
Conformance: Output should be standard (like emails must have user@domain format)
Ordering: Input ordering affects the output or not
Range: Defined limit for input (like 0 > age > 120)
Reference: The input/ouput may require a previous state
Existence: The inputs may not exact (entering null or whitespaces)
Cardinality: Off-by-one errors (forgetting to iterate the last item)
Time: What happens if input has wrong time (date/time)
