## | Unit Testing |

A unit of work can be a single method, a whole class or multiple classes
working together to achieve one single logical purpose that can be verified

Unit Testing: Dedicated, isolated testing per unit

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- |
| Very Fast | | Some bugs can't be reproduced |
| Easy to control (parameterized) | Less real |
| Easy to write | | 

## | Integration Test |

Tests interface between components or interactions to different part of the
system such as OS, file system, hardware, other interfaces, etc


## | System Testing or Black Box Testing |

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| Realistic | Very Slow |
| User perspective | Hard to write |
| Flaky | |



System Testing: 

| Testing Pyramid |

Prioritize Units Tests -> Integration Tests -> System Tests -> Manual Tests

Unit Test: Any rule that can be standardized, such as roman numerals or package management
Itegration Test: Whenever different parts of the system interacts.
System Test: Only to test non-stopping parts (such as payment process in online shop)
Manual Test: Exploratory testing, to find edge cases and general humane exploration


| Mock Objects |

An object that simulates another components, such as database, file system, etc, to test
the real test. This helps in avoiding "complex integration for tests' sake", testing
untestable things (like database crashing, otherwise we'd need to shutdown database to test)

Mocks can be of multiple aspects, such as Exceptions, Database Access, third-party libraries,
interfaces, complex classes, etc

| Mockito |

A Java mocking framework to help simulate external components of a program.

| Dependence Injection Principle |

A software design principle that enables loose coupling between compoments.
An example is to provide a dependency from outside (e.g. through contructor)
instead of creating it internally, which makes it modular and flexible.

| Controllability |
Determines the work it takes to set up and run test cases and the extent to which individual functions and features of the system under test (SUT) can be made to respond to test cases.
| Observability |
Determines the work it takes to set up and run test cases and the extent to which the response of the system under test (SUT) to test cases can be verified.
