| Structural Testing |
Systematically breaking down a software to
test its components through various means

| Code Coverage |
How many components of a softwares have been
tested

| Partitions |
A set of test to conduct per the requirements

| Types of Code Coverage |
Line Coverage: How many lines of code covered
Branch Coverage: How many branches of a program are covered
Condition Coverage: How many conditions are tested of a program
Path Coverage: How many possible paths are tested.
Modified Condition/Decision Coverage: Testing oly the conditions that yield different results

| Line Coverage |
At least single test passing through all the lines of the program
Line Coverage % = (Lines Tested / Total Lines) * 100

| Branch Coverage |
At least one test passing through all the branches

| Condition Coverage |
At least one test passing through all the individual branches if
conditions are changed

| Path Coverage |
At least one test passes through all the possible paths for all
the possible inputs (impossible to test in most cases)

| Modified Condition/Decision Coverage |
Testing a select few paths with the help of a truth table

| Tools |
Maven: For running CLI tests in Java
CMake: For running CLI Test in C
JUnit: Java Library for testing
CUnit: C Library for testing
Playwright: Javascript library for testing

| Methodologies |
Functional Testing: Think in the terms of the requirements (paritions, boundaries, etc)
Structural Testing: Derive test from the structure
