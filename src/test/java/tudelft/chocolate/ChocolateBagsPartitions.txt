From the perimeters of ChocolateBags.calculate(small, big, total),
we learn that
total = total capacity of a bag
big = 5 units per capacity
small = 1 unit per capacity

`With that, we make the following partitions`

## Partition: total
| Partition | Condition | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | total < 0 | Invalid input |
| T2 | total = 0 | No bags needed |
| T3 | 1 <= total < 5 | No big bags possible |
| T4 | total >= 5 | Big bags possible |

## Partition: big
| Partition | Condition | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B1 | big < 0 | Invalid input |
| B2 | big = 0 | Only small bags possible |
| B3 | big > 0 | Big bags possible |

## Partition: small
| Partition | Condition | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | small < 0 | Invalid input |
| T2 | small < remainingTotal | return -1 |
| T3 | small > remainingTotal | return remainingTotal |

`Test Cases with different outcomes`

## Enough small bags
total = 3
big = 1
small = 8
